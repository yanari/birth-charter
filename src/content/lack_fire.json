  "description": "These people struggle to become self-expressive and assertive, but they alternate between withholding themselves and expressing themselves in an overly dramatic manner. They are either tangled up in a hectic schedule of impersonal activities or, in contrast, become overly preoccupied with their personal experience. They may look to others for inspiration and motivation because they are not often aware of or enthusiastic about new possibilities. They often feel passive and detached or uninvolved; they seek deeper personal and emotional involvement in life.",
