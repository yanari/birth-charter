People with Water as the dominant element (6 or more water points) in the birth chart frequently lose themselves in their feelings or the feelings of others, and have difficulty maintaining their separateness. Their extreme sensitivity often leads them to withdraw into themselves. Often quite psychic, they respond with great compassion to the needs of other people.
