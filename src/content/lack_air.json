  "description": "These people often hunger for social interaction and they are very concerned with communication, yet they frequently feel out of contact of misunderstood. They may prefer to express themselves non-verbally, through writing rather than the spoken word. They learn primarily from experience rather than from the intellect. Nevertheless, they are endlessly conceptualizing and clarifying their thinking. They may lack objectivity and thus gain understanding of themselves only through receiving feedback from other people.",
