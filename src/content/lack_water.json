  "description": "These people have an emotional vacuum which they attempt to fill by turning to spiritual realms or universal truths. This is an attempt to find meaning in their lives. Their difficulty remaining in touch with and expressing their feelings may lead them to form relationships with overly emotional people or to become addicted to excitement and intensity. Because they may not be aware of or able to respond empathetically to other people's feelings, they try to prove that they are sensitive by acting out nurturing activities, such as cooking a meal, or by acting overly concerned.",
