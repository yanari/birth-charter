People with Earth as the dominant element (6 or more earth points) in the birth chart will be concerned with concrete details and tangible results. They will operate most frequently in the world of their senses (physical senses like touch, taste, and smell as opposed to emotional feeling), attuned to their immediate environment, to their physical bodies, and to sensory comforts and pleasures.
