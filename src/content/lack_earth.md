Lack of Earth in the birth chart: These people often develop skills which have no practical application, flit from job to job, or overspend and borrow money freely. Alternatively, they may overemphasize the practical by becoming secretaries or accountants, or being overly concerned about budgeting, details, and order. Because they do not feel grounded, they frequently seek security by adhering to a highly structured system of thought or by following an organized but rigid routine. They may hold onto a job or relationship too long because of the stability and security it provides.
